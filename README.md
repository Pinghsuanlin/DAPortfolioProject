# Portfolio
Upload some of my past work using sql, Python technologies, covering data pulling, data viz, data science and web scraping techniques.

Webscraping: (**bs4, Selenium**)
* webscrapingForMacPro.md file is my past work on auto-scraping for interested values like price, reviews for selected products. I also wrote codes to send email alert if price drops lower than certain price. (Data soucre: Amazon marketplace, pacakge used: requests, bs4)
* Webscraping_seleniumLogin.ipynb file is my aslo last work for webscraping. The challenge part of this work is that it required login, dropdown list to filter table content. (Techniques: Python `Selenium` and time package, Excel writer)

Data Wrangling & EDA: (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib pacakages) 
* salesRevenueEDA.ipynb file is my past work on deploying Exploratory Data Analysis to answer business questions and building data viz with seaborn and matplotlib for attributes' comparison. 
* DataPreprocessingForNYOldLargeBuilding.ipynb file is my past work of data cleaning, wrangling on old and large building in NY under LL84, 87, 97 and 133. (Data soucre: NY Open Data)

Data Modeling: (sklearn)
* ClassificationModelTuning_iris.ipynb is to build random forest with parameters tuning by GridSearch.<br>
* timeseries.py is to build a model to forecast the demand (passenger traffic) in Airplanes. The data is classified in date/time and the passengers traveling per month. (Techniques: **Rolling Statistics, ADF test, ARIMA**)

Yelp API: 
* Yelp_Flask.ipynb file is my past work on turning large (3TB) local dataset to Python Flask for fast data retrieval by keyword. (Data soucre: Yelp data set)

Resource Planning using Critical Path Method:
* projectPlanning.py is an unconstrained resource project that used python `cheche-pm` package to plot out *network diagram*, and *gannt chart*.
